One of the windows
By when the light is turned off
Write a letter in the sky
I left me and went to someone else
I can not forget you.
I am in the sky
Not your love
If you are looking for me,
I will lower the key.
Because it is not forgotten,
I just love you.
I'll wait for you.
My tears of my tears can reach the sky
Someday I will come back to me
I will believe that tears
Not your love
If you are looking for me,
I will lower the key.
Because it is not forgotten,
I just love you.
I'll wait for you.
My tears of my tears can reach the sky
Someday I will come back to me
I'll wait for you.
My tears of my tears can reach the sky
Someday I will come back to me
I will believe that tears
