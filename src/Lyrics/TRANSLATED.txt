This melody (Hey) seems to be somewhere
Small memories that come up My Memories
The sofa on me is big, it's too much (too much)
The more I remember, the Loser
Somewhere, this melody (yeah)
Smiley memories are my memories (OOH)
The sofa on me is big, it's too much (too much)
The more I remember, the Loser
I'm a loser

I promise to give you the world that I want to be your best.
Many eyes mistaken for me, I was chaotic and I was only hard.
I had no lose, but I compared me to me.
I have not been able to
Everyone's words are an excuse for you.
But now I live alone
I'm sorry to sit alone
Money and clothes that can not be used again
A big car to bring you
Well, after I brought it all,
I went to the TV on TV
You do not know yourself, you're next to you.
I fought all day and I do not sleep.
Everything is okay and fill this sofa (OOH, OOH, OOH)
Alone is so big, I need you (hey, need you)
This melody (Hey) seems to be somewhere
Small memories that come up My Memories
The sofa on me is big, it's too much (too much)
The more I remember, the Loser
Somewhere, this melody (yeah)
Smiley memories are my memories (OOH)
The sofa on me is big, it's too much (too much)
The more I remember, the Loser
I'm a loser

OOH, the promises that I thought it was eternal
You and I have two
My eyes that I have not seen when I can not see the front
I saw my eyes together in winter (hey)
I was burning, no matter how cold I (I WITH YOU)
LOVIN 'You (Lovin' you
When I said,
The lyrics of the songs that I have two
The melody that I thought was familiar with
The title that was fixed
I did not say I could not say (you need it)

This melody (Hey) seems to be somewhere
Small memories that come up My Memories
The sofa on me is big, it's too much (too much)
The more I remember, the Loser
Somewhere, this melody (yeah)
Smiley memories are my memories (OOH)
The sofa on me is big, it's too much (too much)
The more I remember, the Loser
I'm a loser
