I see demons in the mirror when I’m doin coke lines
Angels whisper in my ear, the devils not that far behind
I can see it in your tears, every time you start to cry
And I really want you here, but i think I changed my mind

Blood & Roses shawty lets go bitch
Pullin up slow with a pocket full of poses

It’s been a minute since me n you kicked it, it’s crazy how time flies
Cupid shot us and then he was outta there just like a drive by
I was committed and you were committed and I would say why why, sometimes I remember the skyline
And everyone would get so sky high
You were my baby we would go crazy
We had some problems, you was addicted to drama
Younger version of your momma
I got back into my old ways, started reminiscing of my old days
Now 
Now I’m dealing with the Karma

Blood & Roses shawty lets go bitch
Pullin up slow with a pocket full of poses

I think it’s time I let you know
That I really miss you so
Never wanna let it go
But I gotta let it go
I just gotta hit the road
Know I got a lot of goals
We both got a lot of goals
But I can’t stay home
Done a lot for me
And I’m gone miss you being on top of me
Imma miss you hanging with this spot with me
But let’s keep it real I got a lot dreams
I’m chasing I been searching for greatness
I’ve been feeling so complacent, I can no longer take this
Time to shake this
~SPEED GANG
Yeah I gotta shake away all the feelings & the pain
I don’t wanna go with you
I just gotta get away
Bitch you gotta die now
Gotta leave my mind now
And all them tears you cried now
Were fake as you oh why oh!
And every time you told me that you loved me was a lie!
And now the feelings I put in it just a waste of time!
The blood drips
My mistress
Your fetish
Addiction
Your beauty
The sickness
