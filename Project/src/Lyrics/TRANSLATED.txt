The day I saw the first picture
Thirty days
Since that day,
You just wait one

Today's habits like habits
To you
As the world's most happy person
I love you so much

I thought I would love you.
On that day we first met
In love in time
You shaken
Then I'll catch you like that

I do not like it too comfortable.
It's too long to love
Sick tears shedding you
You have a bad heart
I thought I would love you.
On that day we first met
In love in time
You shaken
Then I'll catch you like that

How hard I did not have my tears
You wrap warmly
Oh - I knew I'd love you.

On that day we first met
In love in time
I'll catch you that you shaken.
Do not worry anything.
Like the day that day,
